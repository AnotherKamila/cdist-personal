# cdist-personal
my cdist config for personal computers (laptop, LEGO Mindstorms brick, etc.)

I use configuration management everywhere. (Well, actually, of course I don't, but I really should.)
I picked [cdist](https://github.com/ungleich/cdist/), because it is very simple, it doesn't get in the way like some other configuration management tools do, and because I think having a proper programming language for generating the configuration is a good idea (despite the drawbacks).

This repo stores my `.cdist` for my laptop and other personal devices.
